I took this opportunity to learn about [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), a new concept which was introduced in the latest release of React. Hooks are being added to React as an alternative to classes. Hooks allow much of the functionality which was only available to classes – such as lifecycle methods and state – to now be available to simple components. I used boilerplate CSS as I was not seeking to develop those skills with this project.
